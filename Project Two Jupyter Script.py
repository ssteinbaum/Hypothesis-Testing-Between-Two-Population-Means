# # Project Two: Hypothesis Testing
# 
# You are a data analyst for a basketball team and have access to a large set of historical data that you can use to analyze performance patterns. The coach of the team and your management have requested that you perform several hypothesis tests to statistically validate claims about your team's performance. This analysis will provide evidence for these claims and help make key decisions to improve the performance of the team. You will use the Python programming language to perform the statistical analyses and then prepare a report of your findings for the teamâ€™s management. Since the managers are not data analysts, you will need to interpret your findings and describe their practical implications. 
# 
# 
# The ELO rating, represented by the variable **elo_n**, is used as a measure of the relative skill of a team. This measure is inferred based on the final score of a game, the game location, and the outcome of the game relative to the probability of that outcome. The higher the number, the higher the relative skill of a team.
# 
# 
# In addition to studying data on your own team, your management has also assigned you a second team so that you can compare its performance with your own team's. 
#

# The dataframe for the assigned team is called assigned_team_df. 
# The assigned team is the Bulls from 1996-1998.
assigned_years_league_df = nba_orig_df[(nba_orig_df['year_id'].between(1996, 1998))]

# Range of years: 2013-2015 (Note: The line below selects all teams within the three-year period 2013-2015. This is not your team's dataframe.
your_years_leagues_df = nba_orig_df[(nba_orig_df['year_id'].between(2013, 2015))]

# The dataframe for your team is called your_team_df.
your_team_df = your_years_leagues_df[(your_years_leagues_df['fran_id']== 'Hawks')]
your_team_df = your_team_df.reset_index(drop=True)

display(HTML(your_team_df.head().to_html()))
print("printed only the first five observations...")
print("Number of rows in the dataset =", len(your_team_df))


# ## Step 3: Hypothesis Test for the Population Mean (I)
# A relative skill level of 1340 represents a critically low skill level in the league. The management of your team has hypothesized that the average relative skill level of your team in the years 2013-2015 is greater than 1340. Test this claim using a 5% level of significance. For this test, assume that the population standard deviation for relative skill level is unknown. 
# 
# In[20]:


import scipy.stats as st

# Mean relative skill level of your team
mean_elo_your_team = your_team_df['elo_n'].mean()
print("Mean Relative Skill of your team in the years 2013 to 2015 =", round(mean_elo_your_team,2))


# Hypothesis Test
test_statistic, p_value = st.ttest_1samp(your_team_df['elo_n'],  1340)

print("Hypothesis Test for the Population Mean")
print("Test Statistic =", round(test_statistic,2)) 
print("P-value =", round(p_value,4)) 


#   

# ## Step 4: Hypothesis Test for the Population Mean (II)
# 
# A team averaging 106 points is likely to do very well during the regular season. The coach of your team has hypothesized that your team scored at an average of less than 106 points in the years 2013-2015. Test this claim at a 1% level of significance. For this test, assume that the population standard deviation for relative skill level is unknown. 
# 
# In[22]:


import scipy.stats as st

# Mean relative skill of your team
mean_pts_your_team = your_team_df['pts'].mean()
print("Mean points of your team in the years 2013 to 2015 =", round(mean_pts_your_team,2))

# Hypothesis Test
test_statistic, p_value = st.ttest_1samp(your_team_df['pts'], 106)

print("Hypothesis Test for Population Mean")
print("Test statistic =", round(test_statistic,2))
print("P-value =", round(p_value,4))


#  

# ## Step 5: Hypothesis Test for the Population Proportion
# Suppose the management claims that the proportion of games that your team wins when scoring 102 or more points is 0.90. Test this claim using a 5% level of significance. 
# 
# In[24]:


from statsmodels.stats.proportion import proportions_ztest

your_team_gt_102_df = your_team_df[(your_team_df['pts'] > 102)]

# Number of games won when your team scores over 102 points
counts = (your_team_gt_102_df['game_result'] == 'W').sum()

# Total number of games when your team scores over 102 points
nobs = len(your_team_gt_102_df['game_result'])

p = counts*1.0/nobs
print("Proportion of games won by your team when scoring more than 102 points in the years 2013 to 2015 =", round(p,4))


# Hypothesis Test
test_statistic, p_value = proportions_ztest(counts, nobs, 0.90, prop_var=0.90)

print("Hypothesis Test for the Population Proportion")
print("Test Statistic =", round(test_statistic,2)) 
print("P-value =", round(p_value,4))


# ## Step 6: Hypothesis Test for the Difference Between Two Population Means
# The management of your team wants to compare the team with the assigned team (the Bulls in 1996-1998). They claim that the skill level of your team in 2013-2015 is the same as the skill level of the Bulls in 1996 to 1998. In other words, the mean relative skill level of your team in 2013 to 2015 is the same as the mean relative skill level of the Bulls in 1996-1998. Test this claim using a 1% level of significance. Assume that the population standard deviation is unknown.
